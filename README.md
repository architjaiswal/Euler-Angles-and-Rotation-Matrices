# Euler-Angles-and-Rotation-Matrices for Autonomous Robot
Library to obtain rotation matrices from fixed angle and euler angle, and vice-versa

This contains the functions to convert fixed angle and Euler angle rotations into a rotation matrix. It also finds euler angles from rotation matrix for robot kinematics
